    "### Problem B: Analyzing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to calculate the mean and variance for any data set representing a PDF using:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: $ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance (of the PDF):  $ \\sigma_{x}^{2} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 - ( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)^2 = \\bar{x^2} - \\bar{x}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful to quantify the accuracy of the mean estimate that is generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be accomplished using the standard deviation of the mean (also called the standard error). The standard error describes the *dispersion of the mean for many subsets of the data*. There are two ways to determine the standard error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is possible to estimate the standard error using the variance (of the PDF) from a single data set of size N using $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_x^2}{N} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If many independent data sets of length N are used to estimate the mean, there are many estimates of the true mean (all grouped around the true mean, $\\mu$).  From these estimates, we can directly calculate the variance of those estimates of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "In the Jupyter notebook, add to the template in order to do the following for all three data files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using all the data, calculate the mean value without using the `np.mean()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using all the data, calculate the standard deviation without using the `np.std()` function. Compare this to the standard deviation calculated using the built-in `np.std()` function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Divide the data into 20 equally sized sets (✅).  For each of the 20 data sets:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - estimate the mean value, the standard deviation (which describes the dispersion of the data), and the standard error (which describes the dispersion of the means).\n",
    "  - Calculate the standard error in two ways:\n",
    "      1. using the standard deviation of the PDF data and the sample size\n",
    "      2. using the standard deviation of the 20 mean values. You may use the built-in functions\n",
    "  - plot a histogram of the 20 mean values. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions as a comment at the end of problem_b.ipynb:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Does the distribution of the mean values match your expectation based on your estimates of the standard error?\n",
    "  - How do the estimates of the standard error and the distribution of means change if you divide the same sets of data into 40 equally sized sets instead of 20? 80? 100? 1000?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
