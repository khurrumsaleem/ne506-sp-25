    "1. In this problem, you will model an electron source such as would be used in a medical electron accelerator to create a high-energy bremsstrahlung spectrum. **OpenMC can only transport neutral particles (photons and neutrons) currently, so use a photon source instead**.\n",

    "  The source is positioned 5 cm from the target along the z axis.  The standard deviation of the electron beam is 0.1 cm in the x dimension and 0.5 cm in the y dimension.  The energy of the electrons is 6 MeV.  Define the source so that the electron beam is monodirectional, traveling along the negative z axis.  Model a disk of tungsten (2 cm diameter, 1 mm thick) with its circular face perpendicular to the beam at z=0. All particles are sourced at z=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Do the following:\n",
    "    - Use the `sample_source` and `plot_geom_and_source` functions below to plot the geometry and source. Examination of the sites returned from the first function can be useful to verify your source definition.\n",
